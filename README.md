## how to get started with the wiki

- install tfweb & cttools from https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/websites
- lets also stabilize this tool, make sure it works on required platforms (e.g. the builder)
- run the install tool (only works for OSX for now), volunteers welcome (-:
- it will install documentation for the tools as well

## getting started

- when installing the websites and run the tfweb tool you start also this wiki, easy for development
